 eocfm.2001.d: "As the world enters a new age, scholars and state leaders have begun to debate the role of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetStateReligion.GetName] Church within the state. Some push for full state control of the Church, like the Byzantines and Russians, while others advocate a more hands-off approach, with fears that such influence might invite a new form of oppression like that of the Ottomans."
 eocfm.2001.f: "The Eastern Orthodox traditon has diverged heavily from the Roman Catholic tradition in the West. Having rejected the primacy of Rome in Church affairs, the Orthodox Church is led by five Partiarchs, four at the Ancient Seats of Constantinople, Antioch, Alexandria, and Jerusalem, with a fifth seated in Moscow. However, with the rise of Nationalism, states have sought increased control over ecclesiastical affairs."

 eocfm.2002.d: "The Eastern Orthodox Church of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has grown to become the largest and most influential of the Patriarchates of the Eastern Church. With a jurisdiction that now reaches from the banks of the Black Sea in Europe to the Yukon Mountains in North America, Russian Emperors have sought to dominate the Orthodox Church."
 eocfm.2002.f: "In the centuries following the Fall of Constantinople, several political and relgious leaders have argued that Moscow is the successor to the Roman Empire and thus the one true leader of the Christian World. While this has remained unrecognized in this role by other Patriarchs and Christianity at large, Emperors have this to assert influence over Orthodox Christians. In 1774, the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca gave Russia nominal control over the Greek Orthodox communities in the Ottoman Empire, and Nicholas I would spend much of his rule asserting Russian primacy in Eastern Orthodox affairs across the Ottoman state."

 eocfm.2326.t: "Phyletism Addressed"
 eocfm.2326.d1: "Following the guidance and seniority of the Ancient Partiarchatess, the Ecumenical Council has condemned the issue of Phyletism, declaring that any type of ethno-centricism within the Church is an affront to the Ecumene."
 eocfm.2326.d2: "In a revolt against tradition and ecclesiastical structure, the Ecumenical Council has endorsed the establishment of overlapping episcopal sees with the goal of tailoring the divine word to national communities across the Orthodox world."
 eocfm.2326.f: ""Both you (Greeks) and the Bulgarians can equally be accused of phyletism, that is, of introducing ethnic interests into Church questions, and in the use of religion as a political weapon; but the difference lies in the fact that Bulgarian phyletism is defensive, while yours is offensive. Their phyletism seeks only to mark out the boundaries of their tribe; yours seeks to cross the boundaries of Hellenism" -K. Leontiev, 1872"
 eocfm.2326.a: "We are one united Church."
 eocfm.2326.b: "Every community deserves its Church."
 eocfm.2327.t: "An Outdated Calendar"
 eocfm.2327.d: "In response to increasing exposure to the West, several Orthodox countries have begun to adopt the Gregorian Calendar to simplify their interactions in trade and diplomacy. This has prompted a divisive debate within the Church, which continues to use the Julian Calendar."
 eocfm.2327.f: "Proposed by Julius Caesar over a millennium and a half ago, the Julian Calendar replaced the Roman lunisolar calendar. In 1582, Gregory XIII issued an updated calendar to correct for drift from the solar year. While widely adopted across Europe and North America, the Orthodox Church has refused to adopt this change."
 eocfm.2327.a: "We should break free from the past."
 eocfm.2327.b: "This smells of heresey."
 eocfm.2328.t: "The Julian Calendar"
 eocfm.2328.d1: "After weeks of passionate arguments by scholars from across the Orthodox world, the Ecumenical Council has agreed to implement a Revised form of the Julian Calendar. Boasting a precision competitive with that of the Gregorian calendar, the revision has successfully resolved equinox drift for millenia to come."
 eocfm.2328.d2: "In a rebuke to the liberalizing pressure from the West, the Ecumenical Council has rejected any notion of making any changes to the Julian calendar, considering it tantamount to adopting the Gregorian calendar, itself a heretical symbol of the West."
 eocfm.2328.f: ""The difference between the length of the political year of the new calendar and the Gregorian is so small that only after 877 years it is observed difference of dates. -M. Milanković, 1923"
 eocfm.2328.a: "This is the right choice."
 eocfm.2328.b: "We will not abandon our roots."
 eocfm.2329.t: "The Byzantine Commonwealth"
 eocfm.2329.d: "In an arrogant and pompous ceremony in [SCOPE.sCountry('eocfm_conqueror_scope').GetCapital.GetName], [SCOPE.sCountry('eocfm_conqueror_scope').GetName] has declared the creation of the #bold #o Orthodox Commonwealth#!#!. With an aim to unify all [GetReligion('orthodox').GetName] peoples under one banner, this, no doubt, threatens the international order."
 eocfm.2329.f: ""According to the apostolic teaching and the doctrine of the Gospel, let us believe in the one Deity of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, in equal majesty and in a holy Trinity. We authorize the followers of this law to assume the title Catholic Christians; but as for the others, since in our judgment they are foolish madmen, we decree that they shall be branded with the ignominious name of heretics, and shall not presume to give their conventicles the name of churches." -Theodosius I"
 eocfm.2329.a: "What does this mean?"
 
 eocfm.2390.t: "The Patriarchate Rises"
 eocfm.2390.d: "Church bells ring and people cheer as [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] declares the birth of the #bold #o Orthodox Commonwealth#!#!. Beneath the imposing presence of the capitol at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] has been adorned with reconstructions of the old sigils and regalia of the Partiarchs of Constantinople. Stepping forward towards the array of citizens, dignitaries, and clergy, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] stands as a beacon for the future of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] people."
 eocfm.2390.f: ""Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude of the people also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church." -Ignatius of Antioch, ca. 107 AD "
 eocfm.2390.a: "Our Church is Universal."
 eocfm.2391.t: "The Metropolitan Lands"
 eocfm.2391.d: "Our efforts have borne fruit with the rebirth of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Now several voices call for the restoration of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] power and prestige with the return of formerly Byzantine lands to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] hands. It falls to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] to enact the future of the [GetReligion('orthodox').GetName] state."
 eocfm.2391.f: ""For the Fathers rightly granted privileges to the throne of old Rome, because it was the royal city. And the One Hundred and Fifty most religious Bishops, actuated by the same consideration, gave equal privileges to the most holy throne of New Rome, justly judging that the city which is honoured with the Sovereignty and the Senate and enjoys equal privileges with the old imperial Rome, should in ecclesiastical matters also be magnified as she is, and rank next after her." -Canon XXVIII, Council of Chalcedon, 451"
 eocfm.2391.a: "All faithful shall be sheltered by the Patriarchs."
 eocfm.2392.t: "The Orthodox Realms"
 eocfm.2392.d: "Our conquests have finally rescued Eastern Christendom after over a millennium of oppression. Now, the Patriarchs work diligently to restore the churches shuttered during Muslim rule. After debates and deliberations, the Patriarch of Constantinople along with the other Patriarchs of the East have declared the birth of a unified [GetReligion('orthodox').GetName] Domain."
 eocfm.2392.f: ""So know, pious king, that all the Christian kingdoms came to an end and came together in a single kingdom of yours, two Romes have fallen, the third stands, and there will be no fourth. No one shall replace your Christian Tsardom according to the great Theologian.""
 eocfm.2392.a: "The Eastern Church is whole, let us count our blessings."
 eocfm.2393.t: "The Capture of the Great Mosque"
 eocfm.2393.d: "Our righteous crusades against the Saracens have brought their jewel, the heathen city of Mecca, into our grasp."
 eocfm.2393.f: "One by one, rank after rank of Byzantine soldiers advanced into the city. There we beheld the Great Mosque, and at its heart the pagan relic, the al-Ḥajaru al-Aswad... the #black Black Stone#!."
 eocfm.2393.a: "We bring no peace. Burn it all down."
 eocfm.2393.b: "We will turn it into a museum."
 eocfm.2393.c: "The Saracens kept peace in Jerusalem. We will keep peace in Mecca."
 eocfm.2394.t: "The Ancient Patriarchates"
 eocfm.2394.d: "After centuries of separation, the great seats of Eastern Christendom have been returned to the rule of the Emperor in Constantinople."

 eocfm.2394.a: "Mother Mary smiles upon us."
 eocfm.2395.t: "The Restoration of the Pentarchy"
 eocfm.2395.d: "By the Grace of God and through the valiant efforts of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state, we have brought all five of the original seats of Christianity under the umbrella of the Orthodoxy. In an auspicious ceremony in the heart of the Vatican, the Patriarchs of the Church have declared [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to be the sole defender of and authority over the Church of the East."
 eocfm.2395.f: "As it was in Roman times, the church is once again unified under the control of a singular state that both supports and oversees its ecclesiastic functions."
